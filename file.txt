React is a single Page application.
React uses the concept of virtual DOM and all the manipulations in the DOM which has to be done is done in the virtual DOM and this way it is 
memory efficient. Only when there is a state change then React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only those parts of the
real DOM which needs a change.

To create a react app : npx create-react-app namaste-world
Move to the folder and do : npm start to start the development server
When we create a react app we get 3 folders :
1. node_modules: all the dependencies will be there in this folder

Components in React:
1. Functional Components
2. Class Components
Components returns JSX(Javascript XML)
JSX expressions must have only 1 parent element

Install simple react snippets and then do cc for class Component creation

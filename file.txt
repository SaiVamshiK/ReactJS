React is a single Page application.
React uses the concept of virtual DOM and all the manipulations in the DOM which has to be done is done in the virtual DOM and this way it is 
memory efficient. Only when there is a state change then React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only those parts of the
real DOM which needs a change.
